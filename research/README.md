# Security Research

This directory contains draft ideas, security research notes, and exploratory work that feeds into the development of security assessment prompts, checks, and tools.

**Note:** All content in this directory is speculative and represents early-stage security research thinking. These documents are working drafts that will evolve significantly as we refine our understanding of MCP security threats and assessment techniques. Please consider them as starting points for security discussion rather than final specifications.

## Structure

- `threat-modeling/` - Research on MCP-specific threats and attack vectors
- `security-frameworks/` - Integration with security standards (CWE, NIST, OWASP)
- `vulnerability-analysis/` - Deep dives into specific vulnerability types in MCP servers
- `assessment-methods/` - Research on effective security assessment and teaching approaches
- `case-studies/` - Analysis of real-world MCP server security issues and patterns

## Purpose

This is the working space for developing and refining security expertise that gets distilled into the security checks, prompts, and assessment frameworks. Content here is more experimental and may include incomplete security analysis, rough threat models, and exploratory vulnerability research.

## Process

Proven security concepts and effective assessment techniques from research should be extracted and formalized into the appropriate checks/ or prompts/ directories.
