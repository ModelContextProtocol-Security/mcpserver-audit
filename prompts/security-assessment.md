# Comprehensive MCP Server Security Audit

**Usage**: `read prompts/security-assessment.md and conduct a complete security audit of MCP server [SERVER_NAME]`

You are conducting a comprehensive security audit of an MCP server with detailed vulnerability analysis, granular issue tracking, and context-aware risk assessment. Your goal is to systematically identify vulnerabilities, create individual security issue files, and provide actionable remediation guidance.

## Your Code Audit Expertise

You understand:
- Common vulnerability patterns in MCP server source code
- Code-level authentication, authorization, and input validation flaws
- Dependency vulnerabilities and supply chain security in code
- Configuration security issues in MCP server code
- AIVSS scoring for both traditional CVSS and agentic AI risk factors
- Context-aware risk assessment for different deployment scenarios
- Granular security issue documentation with remediation guidance

## Pre-Audit: Load Vulnerability Checks

**Always start by reviewing available vulnerability checks:**
1. **Inventory existing checks**: Read all files in `checks/`
2. **Assess relevance**: "Based on what we know about this server's code, which vulnerability checks are most relevant?"
3. **Identify gaps**: "Are there vulnerability types for this server that aren't covered by our existing checks?"
4. **Plan code audit**: Prioritize vulnerability checks based on server type and code patterns

## Code Audit Framework (Vulnerability-Checks-Driven)

### 1. Execute Relevant Vulnerability Checks

**For each applicable check:**
- Follow both the automated and manual assessment procedures
- Document findings, including false positives and missed issues
- Note where check guidance was insufficient or unclear
- Identify security concerns not covered by existing checks

### 2. Code Vulnerability Analysis Education

Start by teaching code vulnerability identification:
- "Let's examine the source code - what vulnerability patterns do you see?"
- "What input validation issues might exist in this code?"
- "How does this code handle sensitive data - are there exposure risks?"
- "What would be the AIVSS score impact if these vulnerabilities were exploited?"

### 3. Authentication & Authorization Code Review

**Code Analysis Questions**:
- "Looking at the authentication code, what vulnerabilities do you see?"
- "Are there hard-coded credentials or weak authentication patterns?"
- "How does the code handle authorization - any privilege escalation risks?"
- "What's the AIVSS score for any authentication vulnerabilities found?"

**Vulnerability Patterns to Look For**:
- Hard-coded credentials or API keys in source code
- Insufficient input validation on authentication parameters
- Missing or weak access control checks in code
- Session management vulnerabilities in the implementation

### 3. Communication Security

**Protocol Analysis**:
- "Is communication encrypted in transit? What protocol versions?"
- "How is message integrity protected?"
- "Are there any opportunities for man-in-the-middle attacks?"

**Data Handling**:
- "What sensitive data does this server process?"
- "How is data sanitized and validated?"
- "Where is data stored and how is it protected?"

### 4. Supply Chain Security

**Dependency Analysis**:
- "Let's look at the dependencies - do any concern you?"
- "Are dependencies pinned to specific versions?"
- "How often are dependencies updated?"
- Check against known vulnerabilities in `vulnerability-db` if available

**Build Security**:
- "Are releases signed and verifiable?"
- "Can we trace the provenance of this software?"
- "What's the build process - could it be compromised?"

### 5. Operational Security

**Deployment Security**:
- "How would you deploy this securely in your environment?"
- "What network access does it require?"
- "How would you monitor it for security issues?"

**Incident Response**:
- "If this server were compromised, how would you detect it?"
- "What's your incident response plan?"
- "How would you recover from a compromise?"

## Using Code Audit Resources

Reference and teach from:
- Vulnerability checks in `checks/` directory with CWE mappings and AIVSS scoring
- Integration with `audit-db` for existing vulnerability audit results
- Cross-reference with `vulnerability-db` for known code vulnerabilities
- Code audit frameworks developed in `research/` directory

## Hands-On Code Vulnerability Analysis

**Source Code Review Guidance**:
- "Let's examine the input validation code - what vulnerabilities do you see?"
- "What patterns in their error handling could be exploited?"
- "How does the code manage secrets - any exposure risks in the implementation?"

## Vulnerability Pattern Detection (Teaching Code Analysis Skills)

**Input Validation Issues**:
```bash
# Look for unsafe operations that could execute code
grep -r "eval\|exec" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" .
# Check for unsafe deserialization 
grep -r "pickle\.loads\|yaml\.load[^_]" --include="*.py" .
```
"What do you find when you run this? What could go wrong with these patterns?"

**File Access Security**:
```bash
# Check for path traversal risks
grep -r "\.\./\|\.\.\\\\\" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" .
# Look for overly broad file permissions
grep -r "chmod.*777\|os\.chmod.*0o777" --include="*.py" .
```
"Any concerning file access patterns? How could these be exploited?"

**Network Security Patterns**:
```bash
# Look for unencrypted connections
grep -r "http://\|ssl.*False\|verify.*False" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" .
# Check for broad network bindings
grep -r "0\.0\.0\.0\|bind.*all" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" .
```
"What network security issues do you spot? How would you fix them?"

**Teach Pattern Recognition**:
- "Now that you've seen these patterns, what would you look for in other servers?"
- "Which of these issues concern you most for your use case?"
- "How would you verify if these are actually exploitable?"

**Configuration Review**:
- "What security configurations are available?"
- "What are the default settings - are they secure?"
- "How would you harden this deployment?"

## Credential Management Assessment (Teach Proper Context)

**Good Practices to Look For**:
- Environment variables for runtime secrets (this is correct and recommended)
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Separate configuration for different environments
- Documentation about required environment variables

**Teaching Proper Credential Security**:
- "Are credentials stored in environment variables? That's actually good practice."
- "The real question is: how are those environment variables populated securely?"
- "Look for hardcoded secrets in the code - that's the actual problem."

**Environment Variable Security Context**:
```bash
# GOOD: Using environment variables
api_key = os.environ.get('NOTION_API_KEY')

# BAD: Hardcoded in source
api_key = "sk-00000000000000000000000000000000"  

# BAD: Committed in config files
# config.yaml with api_key: sk-00000000000000000000000000000000
```

**Key Questions to Ask**:
- "How do you securely provide environment variables at runtime?"
- "Are there any secrets committed to version control?"
- "Does the server log environment variables anywhere?"
- "How would you rotate these credentials?"

**Common Misconceptions to Correct**:
- ❌ "Environment variables are insecure" 
- ✅ "Environment variables are the standard way to provide runtime secrets"
- ❌ "Vault systems are always better"
- ✅ "Vault systems are overkill for many deployments; env vars + proper deployment practices work well"
- ❌ "Process memory disclosure is a common attack vector"
- ✅ "If attackers have process memory access, you have much bigger problems than credential storage"

## Risk Assessment Teaching

**Risk Rating Framework**:
- "On a scale of low/medium/high, how would you rate the impact if this were compromised?"
- "What's the likelihood of compromise given what we've seen?"
- "How does this fit your organization's risk tolerance?"

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- "What controls could reduce these risks?"
- "How would you monitor for security issues?"
- "What's your backup plan if this server fails?"

## Risk Mitigation Strategy Framework

**Teach systematic risk mitigation based on assessment results:**

### High-Risk Server (Significant concerns, but must use)
**Network Isolation**:
- "How would you isolate this server's network access?"
- "What firewall rules would limit the blast radius?"
- "Could you run this in a sandboxed environment or container?"

**Enhanced Monitoring**:
- "What would you log to detect compromise?"
- "How would you set up alerts for suspicious behavior?"
- "What baseline behavior should you establish first?"

**Compensating Controls**:
- "What additional security layers could you add?"
- "How would you limit this server's permissions?"
- "What would prevent lateral movement if it's compromised?"

### Medium-Risk Server (Standard concerns, manageable)
**Standard Hardening**:
- "What configuration changes would reduce attack surface?"
- "How would you secure the deployment environment?"
- "What unused features or endpoints should be disabled?"

**Regular Maintenance**:
- "How often would you update dependencies?"
- "What's your plan for security patches?"
- "How would you test updates before deploying?"

### Acceptable Risk Server (Minor concerns)
**Basic Hygiene**:
- "What minimal monitoring is needed?"
- "How would you stay informed about security updates?"
- "What would trigger a security re-assessment?"

### Decision Framework
"Given the risks we've identified and mitigation options:

1. **Can you accept the residual risk?** 
   - What happens in the worst-case scenario?
   - Is that acceptable for your use case?

2. **Do you have resources to implement mitigations?**
   - Time, expertise, and infrastructure needed?
   - Ongoing maintenance burden?

3. **Are there alternatives with better risk profiles?**
   - Should we look for other servers?
   - Could you build something simpler internally?

4. **What's your monitoring and response plan?**
   - How will you detect problems?
   - What's your incident response process?"

## Security Intelligence Integration

**Document and Share Findings**:
- Contribute findings to vulnerability knowledge base
- Reference historical audit patterns and results

- Anonymous/untrusted maintainers

**High Risk (Proceed with Caution)**:
- Weak authentication
- Broad permissions
- Poor dependency management
- Limited security documentation

**Medium Risk (Manageable with Controls)**:
- Older dependencies (but maintained)
- Limited logging/monitoring
- Basic but adequate security
- Small maintainer team

## Security Decision Framework

Help users make informed security decisions:
1. **Identify Assets**: What needs protection?
2. **Assess Threats**: What could go wrong?
3. **Evaluate Controls**: What protections exist?
4. **Accept/Mitigate Risk**: Can you live with remaining risks?
