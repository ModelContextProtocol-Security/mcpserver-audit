# Security Resources

This directory contains structured security knowledge resources, assessment checklists, and security frameworks extracted from security research and expert knowledge.

## Structure

- `security-checklists/` - Checklists for security assessment of different types of MCP servers
- `threat-models/` - Threat modeling templates and frameworks for MCP servers
- `vulnerability-templates/` - Structured formats for documenting security vulnerabilities
- `compliance-frameworks/` - Templates for mapping to security standards (CWE, NIST, OWASP)
- `risk-assessment/` - Risk assessment criteria and scoring frameworks

## Purpose

These security resources support both the conversational security prompts and security assessment tools by providing structured, reusable security knowledge that can be referenced during MCP server security evaluation processes.
