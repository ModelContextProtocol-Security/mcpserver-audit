# Dynamic Content Download and Execution Security Check

## Security Assessment Metadata

**AIVSS Scoring Capability**: Full
**Confidence Level**: High for clear patterns, Medium for obfuscated patterns
**Complexity**: Moderate to Complex depending on evasion techniques  
**Data Requirements**: Always Available (source code analysis required)
**Time to Complete**: 10 minutes (automated) + 15 minutes (manual verification)
**Reliability Notes**: High confidence for direct patterns, lower for heavily obfuscated code
**Risk Level**: Critical (AIVSS 8.0-10.0 range due to AI autonomy amplification)

## Security Purpose & Context

Dynamic content download and execution represents one of the most severe security risks for MCP servers. Unlike traditional applications, MCP servers operate as intermediaries between AI models and external services, meaning compromised servers can facilitate sophisticated supply chain attacks targeting AI systems and their users.

**Security Impact**: Critical - Remote code execution with AI-amplified impact
**When to Use**: All MCP server security assessments - this is a fundamental vulnerability class
**When to Skip**: Never skip - this is always relevant for MCP servers
**Threat Context**: APT groups, supply chain attackers, malware-as-a-service operations targeting AI infrastructures

## Security Assessment Criteria

### High Confidence Vulnerabilities
- **Clear Download-Execute Patterns**: HTTP downloads followed by eval(), exec(), or file execution
- **Dynamic Import Chains**: Variable-based imports with external URL resolution
- **Subprocess Execution with Downloads**: child_process operations on fetched content
- **VM Context Exploitation**: Using Node.js VM to run downloaded code

### Medium Confidence Security Risks  
- **Steganographic Processing**: Image/binary processing that could extract hidden payloads
- **Complex Execution Chains**: Multi-step processes that eventually enable code execution
- **Configuration-Driven Execution**: External config files that control code paths
- **Plugin/Extension Mechanisms**: Dynamic loading architectures with external sources

### Low Confidence / Expert Analysis Required
- **Highly Obfuscated Patterns**: LLM-generated or advanced obfuscation hiding execution
- **Supply Chain Injection**: Compromised dependencies with execution capabilities
- **Memory Corruption Exploitation**: Buffer operations that could enable code injection

## Automated Security Assessment (For AI Assistants)

### High Confidence Vulnerability Detection
```bash
# Direct code execution patterns
semgrep --config=/path/to/dynamic-execution-rules.yml --json .

# HTTP client usage analysis
grep -r "fetch\|axios\|request\|http\.get\|https\.get" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# Dynamic imports and require patterns
grep -r "import(" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
grep -r "require.*\$" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# Child process execution
grep -r "spawn\|exec\|fork" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# VM context usage
grep -r "vm\.runInNewContext\|vm\.runInThisContext\|eval" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# File system operations that could write executables
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | xargs grep -l "writeFile.*\.exe\|writeFile.*\.dll\|chmod.*755"
```

### AIVSS Risk Factor Assessment
```bash
# AI Autonomy Risk Assessment (AARS factors)
# Check for autonomous decision-making capabilities
grep -r "decision\|autonomous\|self-" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# Tool use amplification factors
grep -r "tool.*use\|execute.*tool\|invoke.*tool" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# Network connectivity scope (higher risk = higher AARS)
grep -r "http.*://\|fetch.*http\|axios.*http" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . | wc -l
```

**Automation Reliability**: High for direct patterns (eval, exec, spawn), Medium for obfuscated patterns requiring expert analysis

## Manual Security Assessment (For Humans)

### Step-by-Step Security Checklist
- [ ] **CVSS Base Score Assessment**: Evaluate direct code execution capabilities (8.0-10.0 base score)
- [ ] **AARS Factor Evaluation**: Assess AI autonomy amplification (typically +1.0 to +2.0)  
- [ ] **Threat Model Integration**: Consider deployment context and attack surface
- [ ] **Context-Specific Risk Assessment**: Evaluate data sensitivity and network exposure

### Key Security Questions to Ask
- **High Confidence (CVSS)**: "Does the server download and execute external content without user verification?"
- **Medium Confidence (AARS)**: "Could an AI model trigger or influence the download/execution process?"
- **Expert Analysis**: "Are there complex execution chains that could be exploited by sophisticated attackers?"

### Human Security Verification Points
- Review HTTP client instantiation and URL sources
- Trace data flow from external sources to execution contexts
- Analyze file system operations for executable creation
- Verify subprocess and VM context usage patterns

## Secure vs. Vulnerable Patterns

### Excellent Security Examples
**Pattern**: Static imports only, no dynamic loading
```typescript
// SECURE: Static imports with explicit dependencies
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';
import { getConfig } from './config.js';

// All HTTP requests go to user-configured endpoints only
const api = new RestApi(userConfiguredHost);
```
**Why Secure**: No external code execution, controlled HTTP communication
**AIVSS Context**: Eliminates both CVSS execution vectors and AARS amplification
**Confidence**: High - clearly observable secure pattern

### Vulnerable Security Examples  
**Pattern**: Dynamic content download with execution
```typescript
// VULNERABLE: Dynamic code execution from external source
const response = await fetch(externalUrl);
const code = await response.text();
eval(code); // Critical vulnerability

// VULNERABLE: Dynamic import with variable URLs
const modulePath = await getRemoteModulePath();
const module = await import(modulePath);
```
**Why Vulnerable**: Enables arbitrary remote code execution
**AIVSS Scoring**: CVSS 9.0+ (network exploitable RCE) + AARS 1.5+ (AI amplification)
**Confidence**: High - clearly identifiable vulnerability pattern

### Ambiguous Security Cases
**Pattern**: HTTP client with restricted URL patterns
```typescript
// AMBIGUOUS: Could be secure or vulnerable depending on URL validation
const client = axios.create({ baseURL: config.serverUrl });
const response = await client.get(userProvidedPath);
```
**Context Factors**: URL validation strength, user input sanitization
**Threat Model Impact**: Risk varies by deployment scenario and user trust level
**Assessment Approach**: Trace URL construction and validation logic

## Security Assessment Confidence Indicators

### High Confidence Security Results
**When to Trust**: Clear eval/exec patterns, obvious download-execute chains, direct subprocess usage
**Minimum Security Data**: Source code access with dependency analysis
**Strong Security Signals**: HTTP clients + code execution in same codebase

### Low Confidence Security Warnings
**Security Assessment Red Flags**: Heavily obfuscated code, complex execution chains, LLM-generated patterns
**Data Quality Issues**: Incomplete source code, missing dependency information
**External Security Factors**: Third-party modules with hidden execution capabilities

### Improving Security Assessment Confidence
**Additional Security Data**: Dependency tree analysis, runtime behavior monitoring
**Cross-Validation**: Network traffic analysis, dynamic analysis tools
**Threat Evolution Factors**: New obfuscation techniques, AI-generated evasion methods

## Security Justification & Evidence

### Why This Security Assessment Matters
**Impact on Security Posture**: Complete compromise of MCP server and connected AI systems
**Risk Implications**: Supply chain attacks, data exfiltration, lateral movement to AI infrastructure
**Threat Actor Interest**: High-value targets for APT groups and cybercriminals
**AIVSS Relevance**: AI autonomy amplifies impact through automated exploitation

### Supporting Security Evidence
**Research Basis**: MITRE ATT&CK T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer)
**Security Standards**: CWE-94 (Code Injection), CWE-829 (Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Source)
**CVE References**: CVE-2021-44228 (Log4j), CVE-2022-0144 (Node.js), CVE-2023-23920 (crypto-js)
**Real-World Exploits**: SolarWinds supply chain attack, NPM package poisoning campaigns

### Security Decision Weighting
**Critical Security Factor**: Any confirmed download-execute capability should prevent deployment
**Supporting Risk Factor**: Complex execution chains require enhanced monitoring
**Context Dependent Risk**: Steganographic processing varies by server purpose

## Security Integration Guidance

### Using High Confidence Security Results
- Immediately flag servers with confirmed download-execute capabilities
- Weight CVSS base scores heavily (8.0+) with AARS amplification (+1.0 to +2.0)
- Recommend immediate remediation before any deployment

### Handling Low Confidence Security Results
- Require expert security review for ambiguous patterns
- Implement enhanced monitoring for suspected but unconfirmed risks
- Clearly communicate uncertainty levels to users

### Combining with Other Security Checks
- Cross-reference with credential management check (passwords could enable access)
- Combine with network security assessment (attack vector analysis)
- Integrate with dependency analysis for supply chain risk

## Common Security Assessment Pitfalls

### Security Assessment Errors
- Missing obfuscated execution patterns (LLM-generated code)
- Underestimating AARS factors for AI-connected systems
- False negatives on legitimate but risky HTTP client usage

### Security Context Mismatches
- Applying web application security models to MCP servers
- Ignoring AI-specific amplification factors
- Overlooking legitimate dynamic loading for plugin architectures

### Security Confidence Misjudgments
- Over-confidence in static analysis for obfuscated code
- Under-estimating supply chain risks in dependency-heavy servers
- Misaligning CVSS base scores with AI deployment context

## Basic Remediation Guidance

### Critical Issues Found
- **Direct Code Execution**: eval(), exec(), VM contexts executing external content
- **Dynamic Module Loading**: import() or require() with external/variable sources
- **Subprocess Execution**: spawn(), exec(), fork() with downloaded content

### Next Steps for Fixing
**For detailed remediation guidance**: Use mcpserver-builder for secure coding patterns and architecture redesign
**For secure deployment**: Coordinate with mcpserver-operator for runtime sandboxing and monitoring
**Immediate priority**: Eliminate any download-execute chains before deployment

## Integration with MCP Security Ecosystem

- **Cross-reference with `vulnerability-db`** for known dynamic execution CVEs in dependencies
- **Document findings in `audit-db`** for community threat intelligence
- **Update `server-db`** with execution capability assessment results
- **Flag for enhanced monitoring** if any dynamic loading capabilities detected
