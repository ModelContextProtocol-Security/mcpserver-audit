# Security Assessment Tools

This directory contains MCP tool implementations that provide functional capabilities for security assessment and analysis of MCP servers.

## Structure

- `vulnerability-scanning/` - Tools for automated security vulnerability detection
- `threat-modeling/` - Tools for structured threat model generation
- `security-analysis/` - Tools for evaluating security characteristics and posture
- `compliance-checking/` - Tools for assessing compliance with security standards
- `risk-assessment/` - Tools for quantitative and qualitative risk evaluation

## Dependencies

These security tools are designed to work with external MCP servers that provide:
- Code analysis capabilities
- Vulnerability database access  
- File system access for security scanning
- Network access for dependency analysis

## Implementation

Security tools will be implemented as MCP tool definitions that can be used by the eventual MCP Server Audit implementation or integrated into other security-focused MCP-compatible systems.
