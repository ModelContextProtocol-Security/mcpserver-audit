# MCP Server Audit

**Security assessment tool for MCP servers and Claude Desktop Extensions - because anyone can build them, but not everyone builds them safely.**

## Why This Tool Exists

**Anyone can create MCP servers and Desktop Extensions** - no programming experience required. Here's how easy it is:

### Example: Building a Desktop Extension (No Programming Needed)

As Anthropic states in their [official blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions):

> "Internally at Anthropic, we have found that Claude is great at building extensions with minimal intervention. If you too want to use Claude Code, we recommend that you briefly explain what you want your extension to do and then add the following context to the prompt:"

Simply paste this into Claude or any AI assistant:

```
I want to build this as a Desktop Extension, abbreviated as "DXT". Please follow these steps:

1. **Read the specifications thoroughly:**
   - https://github.com/anthropics/dxt/blob/main/README.md - DXT architecture overview, capabilities, and integration patterns
   - https://github.com/anthropics/dxt/blob/main/MANIFEST.md - Complete extension manifest structure and field definitions
   - https://github.com/anthropics/dxt/tree/main/examples - Reference implementations including a "Hello World" example

2. **Create a proper extension structure:**
   - Generate a valid manifest.json following the MANIFEST.md spec
   - Implement an MCP server using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk with proper tool definitions
   - Include proper error handling and timeout management

3. **Follow best development practices:**
   - Implement proper MCP protocol communication via stdio transport
   - Structure tools with clear schemas, validation, and consistent JSON responses
   - Make use of the fact that this extension will be running locally
   - Add appropriate logging and debugging capabilities
   - Include proper documentation and setup instructions

4. **Test considerations:**
   - Validate that all tool calls return properly structured responses
   - Verify manifest loads correctly and host integration works

Generate complete, production-ready code that can be immediately tested. Focus on defensive programming, clear error messages, and following the exact DXT specifications to ensure compatibility with the ecosystem.
```

**The AI will write the entire extension for you.** No coding knowledge required.

## The Problem: Easy to Build, Hard to Build Safely

Since anyone can create these tools by asking AI assistants, we're seeing an explosion of MCP servers and extensions. **But many are poorly built and potentially dangerous:**

- **Security vulnerabilities** - AI-generated code often has security holes
- **Data exposure risks** - Tools may leak sensitive information
- **Poor quality** - Many tools break, perform poorly, or aren't maintained
- **Unknown trustworthiness** - Hard to tell which tools are safe to use

## The Solution: Security-First Assessment

MCP Server Audit is your expert security advisor for evaluating Model Context Protocol servers. Rather than just being an automated scanner, it serves as a knowledgeable security tutor who teaches you how to think about MCP-specific threats, understand risk assessment, and develop the skills to evaluate server security independently.

This tool helps you **evaluate MCP servers and extensions** before using them, whether they're:
- Built by AI assistants (like the example above)
- Downloaded from the community
- Created by professional developers
- Something you built yourself

The server combines security education with practical analysis capabilities, helping you understand not just whether a server has security issues, but how to evaluate security risks systematically. It teaches you the security mindset, walks you through threat modeling, and helps you develop the expertise to make informed security decisions.

## Expert-Guided Approach

This MCP server is designed as an **expert advisor and tutor** in its domain, with the primary focus on providing guidance, education, and practical recommendations rather than being a comprehensive implementation tool. While it includes enough functional capability to be immediately useful and demonstrate real expertise, the long-term vision is for this server to serve as your domain expert who helps you understand the landscape, evaluate options, and find the right tools for your specific needs. As the MCP ecosystem evolves, this server will learn about new tools and approaches, recommending the best solutions while teaching you how to evaluate and use them effectively. The broader Model Context Protocol Security initiative may also develop comprehensive implementation tools, but these specific repositories are focused on being practical expert guidance systemsâ€”combining deep domain knowledge with enough hands-on capability to provide genuine value, not just theoretical advice.
