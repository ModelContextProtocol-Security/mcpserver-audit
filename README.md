# MCP Server Audit

**MCP security expert and tutor. Teaches users how to evaluate MCP server security, understand threat models, and perform risk assessments while providing practical security analysis capabilities and guidance.**

## Overview

MCP Server Audit is your expert security advisor for evaluating Model Context Protocol servers. Rather than just being an automated scanner, it serves as a knowledgeable security tutor who teaches you how to think about MCP-specific threats, understand risk assessment, and develop the skills to evaluate server security independently.

The server combines security education with practical analysis capabilities, helping you understand not just whether a server has security issues, but how to evaluate security risks systematically. It teaches you the security mindset, walks you through threat modeling, and helps you develop the expertise to make informed security decisions.

## Expert-Guided Approach

This MCP server is designed as an **expert advisor and tutor** in its domain, with the primary focus on providing guidance, education, and practical recommendations rather than being a comprehensive implementation tool. While it includes enough functional capability to be immediately useful and demonstrate real expertise, the long-term vision is for this server to serve as your domain expert who helps you understand the landscape, evaluate options, and find the right tools for your specific needs. As the MCP ecosystem evolves, this server will learn about new tools and approaches, recommending the best solutions while teaching you how to evaluate and use them effectively. The broader Model Context Protocol Security initiative may also develop comprehensive implementation tools, but these specific repositories are focused on being practical expert guidance systemsâ€”combining deep domain knowledge with enough hands-on capability to provide genuine value, not just theoretical advice.
